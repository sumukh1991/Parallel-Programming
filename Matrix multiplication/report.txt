Description	: Report - Take home assignment


Matrix multiplication :

* Have used non-blocking sends and receives (Isend & Irecv). 

* Have observed weird behaviour at times, where even though all the threads are reaching the print statement written just before the MPI_Finalize() statement, the job gets killed due to reaching the wall time specified while turning in the job.

* However this issue is not prevalent all the times. The results turned in with the assignment worked properly without any issues.

* Have included the job results obtained from the scholar machine (non edited/modified) in the results folder
