Description	: Report - Take home assignment

Graph count :

* Have implemented a modified traverse function, recursively called by the threads from the 'task' and 'parallel for' openMP constructs in the same file (graphCount.c)

* Tested the code multiple times to make sure the program is race free

* Have included the job results obtained from the scholar machine (non edited/modified) in the results folder
